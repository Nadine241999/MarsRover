PART 1 has to be done either with  (BFS) algorithm traverses  OR with functional programming for example lambda expressions
PART 2 is simply have added lists one for obstacles to check with it where we have to stop 


 The actual implementation should be with BFS. The reason is:
Breadth First Search is generally the best approach when the depth of the tree can vary, and you only need to search part of the tree for a solution. For example, finding the shortest path from a starting value to a final value is a good place to use BFS.(Out of topic)
This will enhance the accuracy/ preformance of the code
